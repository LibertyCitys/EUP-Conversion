## Description
The Outfit Conversion Tool is a Python script designed to streamline the process of converting outfit configurations from an INI file format to JSON format. This tool is particularly useful for gamers and modders who utilize outfit presets in their modifications, such as those found in the Emergency Uniforms Pack (EUP) for Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V).

## Conversion Process
The tool automates the conversion process, eliminating the need for manual intervention. It reads the outfit configurations from the `presetoutfits.ini` file and translates them into JSON format, which is commonly used for data interchange. This conversion allows for easier management and integration of outfit presets into various gaming mods and applications.

## Usage
1. Place the `presetoutfits.ini` file in the same directory as the `converter.py` script.
2. Double-click the `runmebro.bat` file to execute the script.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to confirm the conversion process.
